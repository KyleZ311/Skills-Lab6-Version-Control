# Our Program
Our program asks the user for their name and age. It prints out if they can drive if they are 16 and older. If they are not 16 years old, the program says they are unable to drive. 

# Use of Program
In order to use our software, you must make a git clone of it through github. To use it, one must enter their name and age. Once this is done, the rest is done for the user. 

## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
2. Type in `git clone https://github.com/KyleZ311/Skills-Lab6-Version-Control.git` and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the lab (it should be called `Skills-Lab6-Version-Control`)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the lab contents.
5. Launch the `Lab-Exercises.ipynb` notebook. You can also launch `Lab-Lesson.ipynb` if you need a refresher on what the UTA went over in the skills lab.
